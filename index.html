        <p>This is a round based game. Each round players will get a letter from the alphabet. The goal of the game is to write a name (of a human; e.g. Richard), an animal, a place and a thing (e.g. toothbrush) that starts with the letter of that round. When a player finishes the game he should press done, the rest of the player then have 20 seconds to finish. The other players should finish before the countdown. For every correct answer, the player is rewarded 10 points for every correct answer. If any two players get common answer, then 5 points should be rewarded. If the answer is not accepted (e.g. if name of the animal does not exist), or if the entry is not given the player is rewarded 0 points.</p> 
        <p id="lastdiscline"> Only the final points matter.</p>
